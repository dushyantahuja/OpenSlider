## OpenSlider
OpenSlider is a modular camera slider system with multiple axis of movement based on Adamslab Openslider project: https://github.com/Adamslab/OpenSlider

OpenSlider is easily 3D printed, and assembled using commonly available hardware.
I have made a few additions:
+ Two GoPro mounts
+ One Y-Axis mount directly for the camera - to make a more compact system without the Z axis. Can be used for Landscape timelapses.

I have also created an ESP8266 App that allows you to control the slider using the web browser:
