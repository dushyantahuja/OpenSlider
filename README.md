# OpenSlider-Control
ESP8266 Web App to control openSlider (https://github.com/Adamslab/OpenSlider). Based on HTML and JS code from the Smoothieware classic user interface (https://github.com/Smoothieware/Webif-pack/blob/gh-pages/classic/index.html).

Install on ESP8266 - and connect the RX/TX pins to the RAMPS / SKR board's RX/TX pins. The web app sends GCode to the slider every second to control the slider's motion. 

Can also be used as a rudimentary XYZ control for Marlin based "robots"
